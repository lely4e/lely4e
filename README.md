## Hi there 👋
# I’m Olga  

I used to make things *look* good.  
Now I’m learning how to make them *work* good.  

Graphic designer turned aspiring backend engineer — currently deep-diving into code, databases, and that magical thing people call "debugging at 3AM."

## 🛠 Tech Playground
- **Languages & Tools (in progress):**  
  🐍 Python • 🖥 HTML • 🎨 CSS • 🗄 SQLite • 🌶 Flask  

- **Design Sidekick Powers:**  
  ✏️ Photoshop • 🖌 Illustrator • 🎛 Figma • 🖼 Affinity

## 🎭 Personality Mix
- 🎬 Big fan of David Lynch-style films: part dream, part nightmare, and you’re never 100% sure what just happened — kind of like debugging  
- 🐱 Cat whisperer (or servant, depending on who you ask)  
- ☕ Runs on curiosity, sarcasm, and the occasional existential crisis

## ⚡ Current Mission
Leveling up from *“this works on my machine”* to *“this scales in production.”*

💬 *P.S. My code may not always make sense — but hey, neither do David Lynch movies.*  

🎵 *Easter Egg:* Best enjoyed while listening to eerie background music. Don’t ask questions. Just let it happen. 👁️
