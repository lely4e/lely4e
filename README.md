## Hey, I’m Olga 👋

I used to make things *look* good.  
Now I’m learning how to make them *work* good.  

Graphic designer turned aspiring backend engineer — currently deep-diving into code, databases, and that magical thing people call "debugging at 3AM."

## 🛠 Tech Playground
- **Languages & Tools (in progress):**  
  🐍 Python • 🖥 HTML • 🎨 CSS • 🗄 SQLite • 🌶 Flask • 🐘 PostgreSQL • ⚡️ FastAPI

- **Design Sidekick Powers:**  
  ✏️ Photoshop • 🖌 Illustrator • 🎛 Figma • 🖼 Affinity

## 🧜🏻‍♀️ Personality Mix
- 🎬 Big fan of David Lynch-style films: part dream, part nightmare, and you’re never 100% sure what just happened — kind of like debugging  
- 🐱 Cat whisperer (or servant, depending on who you ask)  
- ✨ Runs on curiosity, sarcasm, and the occasional existential crisis

## ⚡ Currently Working On
I'm currently working on a FastAPI-based backend for a group polling and voting app with JWT authentication, PostgreSQL. Focused on clean architecture and robust error handling.
